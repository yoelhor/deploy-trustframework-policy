# GitHub Action for deploying TrustFramework policies

Use this GitHub Action to deploy a TrustFramework Policy into your Azure Active Directory B2C tenant using the [Microsoft Graph API](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/trustframeworkpolicy?view=graph-rest-beta). If the policy does not yet exist, it will be created. If the policy already exists, it will be replaced.

For more information on TrustFramework Policies and the Identity Experience Framework, see the [Azure AD B2C documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory-b2c/custom-policy-overview).

To authenticate to the Microsoft Graph, you will need to obtain client application credentials using [these instructions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory-b2c/microsoft-graph-get-started).
